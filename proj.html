        <h1>AN ANALYSIS OF NEW YORK UBER TRIPS.</h1>
            <body>
                    <p>This analysis will be focused on extracting insights from data collected in New York by rides company Uber.<br> 
                        analysis will be focused on central elements such as highest number of rides by month, week, weekday,<br> 
                        hour among othermore in-depth findings like averages.

                        To begin with, we would need to load packages that will aid us in the analysis to be converted. <br>
                        For this analysis, we will use readr, tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, scales and ggcharts.<br>
                        Readr will help us import the datasets into R, tidyverse will be used to do some data cleaning, <br> 
                        dplyr, to manipulate our dataset to answer a range of questions, ggplot2 to help us build visuals,<br>
                         lubridate will also help us deal with the dates in our dataset, scales wil help us scale our visuals <br>
                         in a more understandable way and ggcharts will be used to build simple and relatively aesthetically pleasing visuals.
                    </p>

                <p>A peek at our dataset structure shows our Date/Time column is in a character format. <br>
                    We would need to convert that  to a proper date-time format before conducting any further action on our dataset.<br>
                     We will then use lubridate to create new columns for month, day, week day and hour.</p>
                <p>We will express the month and weekday columns as categorical variables since they have a finite amount of groups, <br>
                    that is, week days and months. <br>
                    The days of the month will be expressed in an integer format, that is to represent the 1-30/31 days in a month</p>

                <p> As we can see, the total number of rides gradually increased as the year went by. April had the lowest number of rides<br> 
                    and in September, the highest rides total was recorded surpassing 1 million rides. </p>   
            </body>

            <body>
                <p> Now that we know September had the highest number of total rides, wouldn't we want to see what day of the week people booked<br> 
                    a lot of rides or the fewest number of rides? Do people book more trips on say Friday than any day of the week? Or is it Monday?<br>
                     Enough suspense! Let's find out!</p>

                <p> Interestingly, the week day with the highest number of rides was Thursday. <br>
                    Friday comes in close second followed by Wednesday. An interesting pattern the visual above shows us is that,<br>
                     the total number of rides per day peak from Wednesday to Friday, <br>
                     then steeply falls off on Saturday then recovers slowly to peak again on Thursday.</p>

                <p> Okay now time for some more deeper insights. 
                    Does our data have anything else to tell us? We have found the month and day of the week with the highest number of trips<br>
                     but what about the hour of the day in which most rides happen in? Will that reveal something else?</p>

                <p>From our above visual, we definitely have some even more interesting insights we have uncovered.<br>
                     To begin with if we group our data into two parts; 7:00 - 9:00 and 16:00 - 18:00, we can presume that, more New Yorkers use <br>
                     Uber in their evening commute from work than to work. 17:00 recorded more trips than any other hour and we can see a steady decline <br>
                     in trips from that hour to 02:00, the hour of the day with the lowest number of rides, 45,865.<br>
                      This shows us that in New York, Uber is heavily used at every single hour in any given day.</p>

            <body>
                <p>We will now want to check the pattern of weekend trips against working day trips to check for any pattern variation.</p>

                <p> Hmm... interesting. The visuals above show us some difference in ride patterns for weekends. <br>
                    First of, the number of rides on weekends is lower than that of weekdays and the number of rides per hour <br>
                    for weekends peak earlier than that for working days. The pattern of working days show a steady but sure <br>
                    decrease in rides from 17:00 to 02:00 but for weekends, the opposite is true. <br>
                    There is a relatively high and sustained rate of rides from 16:00 through to 00:00. <br>
                    There is then a steady decrease from 0:00 to 05:00 then a consistent increase in rides till 16:00 again, <br>
                    completely different to weekdays where rides are peak at 17:00 and fall off till about 02:00 and increase<br>
                     again till 07:00 and drops till 10:00 then records a steady increase again till 17:00, the peak hour for <br>
                     rides in New York on working days.</p>
